# DNN_OpenCv_FaceExpressionRecognition
This small project firstly a CNN classifier model is trained using some previous data. I had used few images only but for a better result we must use the bigger dataset. Later we used the OpenCv and haar cascade method to capture and detect the face using the webcam which is later used to predict the output.
